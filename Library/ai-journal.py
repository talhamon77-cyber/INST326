Week 1 
This week since it was basic python coding I tried my hardest to not use AI to debug or code at all. 
I ended up being successful and completed the assignment within a couple hours. Since I just finished
moving I don't have access to a gym besides the one on campus I used Chatgpt to schedule a workout for me to use
throughout the week. Here is the chat log: https://chatgpt.com/c/68c777db-1cec-8323-bd31-a30e127d4c9e


Week 2
This week I had not used AI for the assignment but instead collaborated with my group to work on some questions.
I also used AI this week to help me prepare for a presentation I had to do with another group for a different class.
it made me small bullet points using my notes that I had prepared in advance to remember specific points
I wanted to bring up when presenting. Here are those logs! https://chatgpt.com/c/68cb784f-ccd8-832c-bbc1-b5a7cffde6f0


Week 3
This week was much more difficult than the previous ones. This time I had help with AI to figure some things out
such as how to identify parameters when defining functions and the structures of how to use functions in your code, as
well as debugging for the questions 29 and 30 as an example. I also compared the capability of ChatGPT and Deepseek and found
that Deepseek to be much less profieceint when it comes to coding instrucitons in comparison to GPT.
