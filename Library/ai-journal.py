Week 1 
This week since it was basic python coding I tried my hardest to not use AI to debug or code at all. 
I ended up being successful and completed the assignment within a couple hours. Since I just finished
moving I don't have access to a gym besides the one on campus I used Chatgpt to schedule a workout for me to use
throughout the week. Here is the chat log: https://chatgpt.com/c/68c777db-1cec-8323-bd31-a30e127d4c9e


Week 2
This week I had not used AI for the assignment but instead collaborated with my group to work on some questions.
I also used AI this week to help me prepare for a presentation I had to do with another group for a different class.
it made me small bullet points using my notes that I had prepared in advance to remember specific points
I wanted to bring up when presenting. Here are those logs! https://chatgpt.com/c/68cb784f-ccd8-832c-bbc1-b5a7cffde6f0


Week 3
This week was much more difficult than the previous ones. This time I had help with AI to figure some things out
such as how to identify parameters when defining functions and the structures of how to use functions in your code, as
well as debugging for the questions 29 and 30 as an example. I also compared the capability of ChatGPT and Deepseek and found
that Deepseek to be much less profieceint when it comes to coding instrucitons in comparison to GPT.

Week 4
This week I used AI in a few different ways. First, I asked ChatGPT to help me brainstorm ideas for modeling real-world objects as Python classes, 
which helped me clearly see which attributes and methods would make sense for the objects I was thinking about. I also used AI to help me organize 
my thoughts for a discussion post on data ethics. It helped me turn my notes into concise sentences while keeping my own voice intact. Here are the links 
to the chats I used: https://chatgpt.com/share/68cb784f-ccd8-832c-bbc1-b5a7cffde6f0

week 5
This week I only used AI for project 1. I had asked CHATGPT to help me break down project 1 into steps becuase I thought the 
instructions were kind of confusing. It broke it down into steps that were easy to follow. I then asked it to help me think
of different functions that I could work on. After I finished coding the intial parts of the functions, I then asked chatgpt to help
format it using docstrings and to fix any potential errors. Lastly, to finish up project 1 I asked AI to help me navigate through githubs
various menus and options to create the repository following project 1's guidelines. Overall, CHATGPT was very helpful in getting started with
the project
